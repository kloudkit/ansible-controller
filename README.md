[![Latest](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/kloudkit/ansible-controller?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/kloudkit/ansible-controller/releases)

The *Ansible Controller* is a lightweight, containerized solution for managing your
Ansible playbooks.
Simplify your configuration management with a pre-configured, ready-to-use Ansible
environment that runs seamlessly in Docker.

## Usage

The image includes a default inventory *(`/etc/ansible/hosts`)* named `controller` that
runs on `localhost` without root privileges.

To use it, copy the following example playbook:

```yaml
- name: Run something
  gather_facts: false
  hosts: controller

  tasks:
    - name: Just saying hello
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: Hello world! ðŸ‘‹
```

### Run

```sh
docker run --rm \
  # Mount local playbooks directory
  -v ./playbooks:/workspace \
  ghcr.io/kloudkit/ansible-controller \
  # Set playbook variables
  -e FOO=bar \
  # Specify the playbook to run
  play.yaml
```
